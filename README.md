# lwm2m-node

This repository contains a C based implementations for a LwM2M node using the Zephyr RTOS. The node is designed to be used with the Arduino Nano 33 BLE microcontroller and features a CoAP server as well as a CoAP client implementation for communication with other devices. This implementation is part of the proof of concept for the [Matter-LwM2M-Bridge](https://github.com/niklasbhv/matter-lwm2m-bridge). Instructions on how to build this code will follow shortly.
